			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Set up project environment and dependencies",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as this is a straightforward setup task.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves basic project initialization, library installation via pip, and environment variable configuration, which are standard practices with minimal technical challenges or dependencies. Testing is simple verification of imports and variables. Low effort overall."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement bot initialization and basic structure",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into subtasks for bot application setup and handler registration.",
			"reasoning": "Requires integrating python-telegram-bot library, setting up async application, logging, and basic handlers. Moderate effort due to async programming and library-specific APIs, with dependencies on environment setup. Testing involves running the bot locally."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Add user authentication and security checks",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as authentication can be added directly to existing handlers.",
			"reasoning": "Involves adding a simple ID check in message handlers, which is straightforward. Low technical challenge, but critical for security. Testing requires simulating different user scenarios."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement /start command handler",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subdivide into process spawning and initial output handling.",
			"reasoning": "Uses pexpect to spawn CLI process and manage state. Moderate complexity due to process management and error handling. Depends on bot structure and auth. Testing checks process launch and notifications."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement /stop command handler",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as termination logic is simple.",
			"reasoning": "Basic process termination with checks for existence. Low effort, building on /start handler. Testing verifies cleanup and user feedback."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement output capture and relay to Telegram",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into subtasks for regex-based output detection, continuous monitoring via threading/async, and message chunking/sending.",
			"reasoning": "High complexity due to real-time output capture using pexpect expect(), regex matching, avoiding duplicates, and integrating with async Telegram bot. Requires threading or async for monitoring, with challenges in handling large outputs and edge cases. Extensive testing needed."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement text message input relay to CLI",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 1,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subdivide into input sending and triggering output capture.",
			"reasoning": "Forwards text to pexpect process and integrates with output relay. Moderate effort involving stdin handling and state checks. Depends on output capture. Testing ensures CLI interaction."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Add timeout and error handling",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break into timeout configuration and error recovery mechanisms.",
			"reasoning": "Adds expect_timeout to pexpect and handles EOF, crashes, etc. Moderate complexity for robust error management across multiple handlers. Testing involves simulating failures."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Configure prompt detection and customization",
			"complexityScore": 2,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 0,
			"expansionPrompt": "No expansion needed as it's a simple env var addition.",
			"reasoning": "Minor change to make regex configurable via env var. Low effort, enhances flexibility. Testing with different patterns is straightforward."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Test full session flow and performance",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Subdivide into functional flow testing and performance benchmarking.",
			"reasoning": "End-to-end testing of all features, including latency measurement up to 100 interactions. High effort due to comprehensive coverage and performance requirements. Depends on all prior tasks."
